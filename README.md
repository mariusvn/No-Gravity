[PLAY NO GRAVITY - To the space](https://mariusvnh.itch.io/no-gravity)

## Welcome to NO GRAVITY - To the space!

The game is pretty simple. Get all the gold coins and reach the end of the level.
  
To help you achieve this, we've created a whole new tech called the "Neosensor Turbothermal Gravitotron" or NTG for short.

It basically allows you to avoid the gravity field of the earth by teleporting your entire environment to space.

To activate it just press the big red button on your suit, AKA the E button on your keyboard.

To move around, just use your feet or you can use the little buttons on your gloves, otherwise known as the A and D buttons on your keyboard. (if you're using a French keyboard, you can also use the Q button).

Oh and don't forget that you can also use the SPACE button to get a little boost in your legs and jump!

See you explorer.
